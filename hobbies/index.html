      <p>this page will include running updates on my personal interests and projects.</p>
      <p>the main areas i intend to keep posted are crochet and coding projects as these tend to take a long time and are worth documenting thoroughly</p>
      <p>however, i also intend to document snippets of my other interests, such as building mechanical keyboards, restoring guitar hero controllers (maybe some videos of full charts i am proud of?), lego projects / decor, videogames, coffee.</p>
