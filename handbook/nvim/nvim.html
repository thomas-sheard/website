      <h1>Building my Neovim config from scratch</h1>

      <p>
      Since learning Vim motions, Neovim has quickly become my preferred text editor and IDE for writing literally anything. <br>
      As anyone who has gone down the rabbit hole of vim (or more generally, system) customisation (also termed <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn", title="i promise my rice doesn't have any anime girls", target="_blank">ricing</a>) knows - the rabbit hole is <em>deep</em>. <br>
      My Neovim config is forever evolving closer to my idea of a perfect development environment, alongside my understanding of my system as a whole. <br>
      However I find that I modify my config sporadically, in short and intense bursts - such as when my frustration with a certain feature (autopairs..) finally gets the better of me and I decide to 'just do it myself'. <br>
      Increasingly, my Neovim (nvim) configuration has become unwieldy and difficult to maintain with this irregular editing cycle; every time I delve into the dotfiles I have to relearn many things that I have already been through ("<em>ohhhh</em> yes _____ does _____... of course!"), which is frustrating in and of itself, and is also a waste of time; many 2AMs have come and gone while I re-read the LazyNvim documentation instead of actually fixing what I initially intended to. <br>
      This has led me to the (quite rational, I think) decision to to re-write the entire thing from scratch, and document the process for future reference. <br>
      </p>

      <h2>Getting started</h2>

      <p>
      My preferred directory hierarchy for a modular Neovim config looks something like this:

      <div class="code">
        <p>
        ~ <br>
        |-- .config <br>
              |- nvim
                  |- 
        </p>~
      </div>

      </p>
      

    </div>

</body>
</html>
